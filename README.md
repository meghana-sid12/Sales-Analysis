# E-commerce Data Analysis with SQL in BigQuery 🛒📊

## Project Overview 🌐

Embark on a data-driven journey into the world of e-commerce with this project, employing SQL in BigQuery to unravel insights from sales, product, and customer data. The goal is to uncover actionable patterns, calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and guide strategic decision-making for optimal growth.

## Datasets 📂

- [Demographic Table](link-to-demographic-table)
- [Transaction Table](link-to-transaction-table)
- [Products Table](link-to-products-table)

## Project Expectations 🚀

Dive deep into e-commerce data to decipher customer behavior, product trends, and sales patterns. Uncover hidden value through the calculation of various KPIs and metrics, facilitating informed decision-making.

1.	Find the number of orders that have small, medium or large order value (small:0-10 dollars, medium:10-20 dollars, large:20+)

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN sales_value BETWEEN 0 AND 10 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN sales_value BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Large'
    END AS order_category,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
GROUP BY order_category
ORDER BY order_category;
```
 
 
……………………………………………………………………………………….…………………………………………………………………….

2.	Find the number of orders that are small, medium or large order value(small:0-5 dollars, medium:5-10 dollars, large:10+)

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN sales_value BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN sales_value BETWEEN 5 AND 10 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Large'
    END AS order_category,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
GROUP BY order_category
ORDER BY order_category;

3.	Find top 3 stores with highest foot traffic for each week (Foot traffic: number of customers transacting )

WITH RankedStores AS (
    SELECT
        store_id,
        week_no,
        COUNT(DISTINCT household_key) AS customer_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY week_no ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT household_key) DESC) AS store_rank
    FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
    GROUP BY week_no, store_id
)

SELECT
    week_no,
    store_id,
    customer_count
FROM RankedStores
WHERE store_rank <= 3
ORDER BY week_no, store_rank;
 
…………………………………………………………………………………………….…………………………………………………………………
4.	Create a basic customer profiling with first, last visit, number of visits, average money spent per visit and total money spent order by highest avg money
SELECT
    household_key,
    MIN(trans_time) AS first_visit,
    MAX(trans_time) AS last_visit,
    COUNT(DISTINCT basket_id) AS number_of_visits,
    ROUND(AVG(sales_value), 2) AS avg_money_spent_per_visit,
    SUM(sales_value) AS total_money_spent
FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
GROUP BY household_key
ORDER BY avg_money_spent_per_visit DESC;
 
……………………………………………………………………………………………….………………………………………………..
5.	Do a single customer analysis selecting most spending customer for whom we have demographic information(because not all customers in transaction data are present in demographic table)(show the demographic as well as total spent)
SELECT
    D.*,
    T.total_money_spent
FROM myproj2-408807.demographic.demog D
JOIN (
    SELECT
        household_key,
        SUM(sales_value) AS total_money_spent
    FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
    GROUP BY household_key
    ORDER BY total_money_spent DESC
    LIMIT 2
) T ON D.household_key = T.household_key;

 …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
6.	Find products(product table : SUB_COMMODITY_DESC) which are most frequently bought together and the count of each combination bought together. 
SELECT
    p1.sub_commodity_desc AS product_1,
    p2.sub_commodity_desc AS product_2,
    COUNT(*) AS combination_count
FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans t1
JOIN myproj2-408807.sales.product p1 ON t1.product_id = p1.product_id
JOIN myproj2-408807.trans.trans t2 ON t1.basket_id = t2.basket_id
JOIN myproj2-408807.sales.product p2 ON t2.product_id = p2.product_id
    AND p1.sub_commodity_desc < p2.sub_commodity_desc
GROUP BY p1.sub_commodity_desc, p2.sub_commodity_desc
ORDER BY combination_count DESC;
 
……………………………………………………………………………………………….………………………………………………………
7.	Find the weekly change in Revenue Per Account (RPA) (difference in spending by each customer compared to last week) 
SELECT
    household_key,
    week_no,
    sales_value,
    LAG(sales_value) OVER (PARTITION BY household_key ORDER BY week_no) AS previous_week_sales,
    COALESCE(sales_value - LAG(sales_value) OVER (PARTITION BY household_key ORDER BY week_no), 0) AS weekly_change_in_sales
FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans
ORDER BY household_key, week_no;
 
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

8.	This query helps visualize the trend in monthly revenue over time.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(trans_time)) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(trans_time)) AS month, SUM(sales_value) AS monthly_revenue FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans GROUP BY year, month ORDER BY year, month;
 
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
9.	Understand the AOV based on customer segments (e.g., marital status, income).
SELECT d.marital_status_code, ROUND(AVG(t.sales_value), 2) AS avg_order_value FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans t JOIN myproj2-408807.demographic.demog d ON t.household_key = d.household_key GROUP BY d.marital_status_code ORDER BY avg_order_value DESC;
 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
10.	Identify the manufacturers generating the most revenue.
SELECT p.manufacturer, SUM(t.sales_value) AS total_revenue FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans t JOIN myproj2-408807.sales.product p ON t.product_id = p.product_id GROUP BY p.manufacturer ORDER BY total_revenue DESC; 

 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
11.	Understand how often customers make purchases.
SELECT CASE WHEN visit_count = 1 THEN '1' WHEN visit_count BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN '2-5' WHEN visit_count BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' ELSE 'More than 10' END AS visit_frequency, COUNT(DISTINCT household_key) AS customer_count FROM ( SELECT household_key, COUNT(DISTINCT basket_id) AS visit_count FROM myproj2-408807.trans.trans GROUP BY household_key ) AS subquery GROUP BY visit_frequency;
